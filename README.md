Block-chain-based Event Bus wires events to  services and allows distributed validation of shared propagated state.

A catalog event handler gives you persist-cached-access to data sources.

A process manager (BPM) lets you define an application state that travels through user defined workflows.

Workflows are solved  with pluggable runners. Runners may be automatic( batch, streaming), or human driven ( Run on a browser or a mobile device or a desktop application )

For an example see:

```
ForeignKeyAssignationTest
HelloWorldTest
SubmitToApplicationTest
CatalogEngineTest
ServiceRequestValidationTest
ContractListenerTest


```
