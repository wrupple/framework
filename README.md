Event Bus wires events to  services.

A catalog event handler gives you persist-cached-access to data sources.

A process manager (BPM) lets you define an application state that travels through user defined workflows.

Workflows are solved  with pluggable runners. Runners may be programtic ( Spark, AI, custom ), or human driven ( run on a browser or a mobile device or a desktop application )

For an example see:

```
HelloWorldTest
SubmitToApplicationTest
CatalogEngineTest
ServiceRequestValidationTest
EventListenerTest
```
