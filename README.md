Event Bus wires events to  services.

A catalog event handler gives you persist-cached-access to data sources.

A process manager (BPM) lets you define an application state that travels through user defined workflows.

Workflows are solved  with Pluggable runners. Runners may be automatic( Spark, AI, or custom methods), or human driven ( Run on a browser or a mobile device or a desktop application )

For an example see:

```
HelloWorldTest
SubmitToApplicationTest
CatalogEngineTest
ServiceRequestValidationTest
EventListenerTest
```
